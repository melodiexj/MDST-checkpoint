Hello! My name is Melodie Xinyun Jin.
I am a second-year studying Computer Science in LSA.
Fun fact about me: Although English is the only language I would consider myself fluent in, I've studied/practiced a couple of others over the years too.
I've picked up some Mandarin Chinese and the Shanghai dialect from my family.
I've been studying Spanish at school for a while now.
And recently I started learning Japanese on my own.
It's a big mess!
