Hello! My name is Melodie Jin and I am sophomore in LSA majoring in Computer Science.
fun fact: The only language I would say I am fluent in is English, but I've also been learning a few others.
I've picked up some Mandarin Chinese and the Shanghai dialect from my family (but I can't speak or write well, unfortunately)
I've been studying Spanish while attending public school and here at Umich. And I recently started learning Japanese on my own. 
It's a huge mess!
